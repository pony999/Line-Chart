### D3 with React

To set a new React project with D3 use the following steps:

1. Create a new app, called my-d4-app `npx create-react-app my-d3-app`. Change directory into the created folder by using `cd my-d3-app`.
2. Install D3 by running `npm install d3 --save`.
3. Import D3 to App.js by adding `import * as d3 from d3`. You need to use import * (“import everything”) since D3 has no default exported module.
